# flutter_jobs_ffw

My online resume written in Flutter and configured to run on the Web. Flutter Web is currently experimental and, as such, a couple of things do not properly render, many plugins are not supported, etc. However, I like it a lot.

## Code Dependencies

If you wish to run this code on your local machine, Flutter needs to be installed.

See instructions [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for your operating system.

## Starting the app on your local machine

1. Clone this repository or download the zip file.
2. Connect your Android or Apple device to your local machine and make sure it is in developer mode (Android) or it is trusted (Apple). Alternatively, you can open a virtual device in Android Studio and/or Xcode.
3. In a command line, go to the project directory on your computer (wherever your cloned it to, or extracted the zip file) and type:
`flutter pub get`
4. To run in Chrome browser, in the same command line and in the same directory, type:
`flutter run -d chrome`
